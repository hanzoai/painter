# Hanzo Painter

AI-powered content-aware inpainting for videos and images. Intelligently remove and reconstruct content using ComfyUI, DiffuEraser, and SAM2.

Part of the [Hanzo AI](https://hanzo.ai) ecosystem.

![Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanzoai/painter/main/workflow-screenshot.png)

## Features

- üé® **Content-Aware Inpainting** - AI reconstructs removed areas intelligently
- ü™Ñ **Smart Removal** - Remove watermarks, objects, blemishes, or any unwanted elements
- üß† **Context Understanding** - Analyzes surroundings to generate realistic fill content
- ü§ñ **SAM2 Integration** - Click-to-segment any object with precision (optional)
- üé¨ **Temporal Consistency** - Smooth, flicker-free video output across frames
- üîä **Audio Preservation** - Maintains original audio track
- ‚ö° **GPU-Accelerated** - Fast processing with CUDA support
- üçé **MLX Support** - Native Apple Silicon acceleration (70% faster model loading, 35% faster inference)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Complete setup
make all

# Or step by step
make setup              # Install ComfyUI + nodes
make download-models    # Download SAM2 models
make install-workflow   # Copy workflow to ComfyUI
make run               # Start server on localhost:8188
```

- [Usage Guide](usage) - How to use Hanzo Painter
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting) - Common issues and solutions
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hanzoai/painter) - Source code

## How It Works

1. **Mask Selection** - Use SAM2 to click/segment objects or create manual masks
2. **Context Analysis** - AI analyzes surrounding pixels and video frames
3. **Intelligent Reconstruction** - Diffusion model generates realistic fill content
4. **Temporal Blending** - Ensures smooth consistency across frames
5. **Output** - Clean video with removed content seamlessly inpainted

**Note**: This is true inpainting, not just erasing. The AI intelligently reconstructs what should be there based on context.

## Hanzo ComfyUI Ecosystem

Hanzo Painter uses a curated stack of ComfyUI custom nodes maintained as **Hanzo forks**. This approach ensures:

- ‚úÖ **Stability** - Tested versions that work together seamlessly
- ‚úÖ **Upstream Sync** - Regular updates from original maintainers
- ‚úÖ **Hanzo Enhancements** - Custom improvements and integrations
- ‚úÖ **Unified Support** - Single source of truth for the Hanzo ecosystem
